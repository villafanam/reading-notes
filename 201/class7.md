# Class 7 Notes

## [Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

+ Explain why we need domain modeling. 

  + It is the process of creating a model in code for a specific problem. Like a blueprint that has the properties and structure of the program.  

## [HTML Table Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics)

+ Why should tables not be used for page layouts? 

  + Reduce accessibility for visually impaired users 

  + Not automatically responsive  

  + Makes layout more complex to code, maintain or debug 

+ List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.

  + `<th>` table header special cells that go at the start of a column or row 

  + `<td>` table data the content of the table 

  + `<tr>` table row creates a row in a table 

[Introducing Constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)

+ What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it? 

  + Is a function that initializes a new instance of an object. This makes making new object easier and keep all the code for the object in one place 

+ How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor? 

  + `this` in a constructor is the object you are currently in and in an object literal it means the object
