# Class 28--Component Lifecycle / `useEffect` Hook

## [useEffect hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#reference)

+ What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?

  + It let you synchronize a component with an external system  

+ How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?

  + Every time a component renders it will run the code inside `useEffect, meaning it delays a piece of code form running until that render is reflected on the screen

+ What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?

  + Some effects need to specify how to stop, undo, or clean up whatever they were doing. This is done through cleanup functions

## Things I want to know more about

+ How to write an Effect
