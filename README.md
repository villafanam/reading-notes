# My Reading Journal For Code Fellows

Hi, my name is Marco Villafana (he/him). I am an army veteran and live in Washington state. I was an information technology specialist. Where I did desktop support and network support.  Since then, I have recently completed a computer science degree at Central Washington University. I am still undecided on what to specialize in and web design wasn't covered very much in my degree, so I'm interested in finding out if this is something I want to pursue. I am running Windows 11 Pro version 22H2 on my desktop. 

Growth mindset is the definition of mind over matter where through determination or a strong belief in yourself to improve you can better yourself in anything.  

3 reminders to stay in a growth mindset: 

1.  No one is good at it in the beginning 
2.  Never stop trying the more you know the better you will be 
3.  Always Rember that failure is part of the process to success
