# My Reading Journal For Code Fellows

Hi, my name is Marco Villafana (he/him). I am an army veteran and live in Washington state. I was an information technology specialist. Where I did desktop support and network support.  Since then, I have recently completed a computer science degree at Central Washington University. I am still undecided on what to specialize in and web design wasn't covered very much in my degree, so I'm interested in finding out if this is something I want to pursue. I am running Windows 11 Pro version 22H2 on my desktop.
