# Class 7 Notes

## Control Flow 

+ Order in which the computer executes commands in script 

+ Code run form first line to last line in file unless there are loop or conditionals

### JavaScript Functions 

+ **Function** is block of code made to perform a task 

// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2 

+ `function myFunction(p1, p2){}
{
  return p1 * p2;
}`

  + `function` name () 

  + `function`  is keyword 

  + Name for the function 

  + (p1, p2) holds arguments or parameters  

  + {} contains code to execute

+ Return statement tells the function to stop executing and return to execute code after the invoking statement 

### JavaScript Operators 

+ Assignment operator `=` assigns value to a variable 

+ Types of operators 

  + Arithmetic Operators 
    + `+`
    + `-` 
    + `*` 
    + `**` 
    + `/` 
    + `%`
    + `++`
    + `--`  

+ Assignment Operators 
  + `=`
  + `+=`
  + `-=`
  + `*=`
  + `/=`
  + `%=`
  + `**=`

+ Comparison Operators  
  + `==` equal to 
  + `===` equal value and equal type 
  + `!=` not equal 
  + `!==` note equal or not equal type
  + `>` greater than 
  + `<` less than
  + `>=` greater than or equal to 
  + `<=` less than or equal to 
  + `?` ternary operator (if statement short hand) 

+ Logical operators 
  + `&&` and 
  + `||` or 
  + `!` not 

+ Conditional Operators 
  + `?` ternary operator (if statement short hand) 

+ Type Operators 
  + `typeof` 
    + Returns the type of a variable 
    + `intanceof` Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type 

## Things I want to know more about 

+ how bitwise operators work
+ commonly used functions
+ does JavaScript have libraries like the math  libraries
