## [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

+ ### What is functional programming? 

  + Software development that uses pure functions to create maintainable software  

+ ### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? 

  + A function that returns the same result if given the same arguments  

+ ### What are the benefits of a pure function? 

  + They are predictable and easier to debug  

+ ### What is immutability? 

  + Unable to be changed 

  + Data state cannot change after creation  

+ ### What is Referential transparency? 

  + Code that can be replaced with the value it computes and vice versa without changing the meaning or the result of the program

  + Using  `obj = require(‘module path’)`
