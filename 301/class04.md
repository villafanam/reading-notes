# Class 04--React and Forms

## [React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

+ What is a ‘Controlled Component’? 
  + An input form element this controlled by react  

+ Should we wait to store the users' responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why. 
  + Users' responses should be stored in state as soon as possible to make the form available quicker 

+ How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field? 
  + You use the event obj to access the value and take up less space

  console.log(true); 
} else { 
  console.log(false); 
}
``` 
+ `x === y ? true : false; `
