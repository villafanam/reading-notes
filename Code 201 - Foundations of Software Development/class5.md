# Class 5 Notes

## [HTML Media](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding)

+ What is a real-world use case for the **alt** attribute being used in a website? 

  + Used to add a description of the image. When image doesn’t load the text will take its place 

+ How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document? 

  + By using alt text and captions to the describe the image. Their descriptions should be different since they will both appear when the image is gone 

+ Provide an example of when the **figure** element would be useful in an HTML document. 

  + Can be used to display an image with caption in its own semantic element 

+ Describe the difference between a **gif** image and an **svg** image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community. 

  + gif-graphics interchange format 
    + Supports animation by combining images  

  + svg-scalable vector graphics 
    + Use for vector-based graphics 
    + Text files containing source code that draws an image 

+ What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why? 

  + I would use a PNG image since its supported by most browsers and it is lossless meaning there is no loss in quality each time its opened and saved again. 

## [Learn CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) 

+ Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge. 

  + Foreground color is the color of text, text decorations and set the `currentcolor` value 

  + Background color defines the element background color 

+ Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character? 

  + I would make or find a color pallet and use that to color the element background color and text. The color pallet will help the color coordinate and appear pleasing to the eye 
 
+ What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document? 

  + Availability—web safe fonts that are available on most Operating Systems (Windows, macOS, etc.) 

 
+ What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements? 

  + `font-size` is the property that determines text font size 

  + `font-weight` is the property that determine how bold the text is 

  + `font-style` is the property that applies italic styling to text 

+ Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element. 
  + Padding property  
  + Margin property
